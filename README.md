# RetinaNet
RetinaNet is rewarding paper to implement. I have implemented retinanet on coco2017 dataset. The dataset consists of more than 
110,000 images with all the instance of various category. When implementing retinanet it makes lot of sense to try out things
with smaller dataset. The uploded notebook helps you come up with a subset of coco2017 dataset.
